# NASA-Nighttime-Lights-MTA-Infrastructure


### 1: Collecting & Cleaning
The following variables were collected...
- Population density
- Monthly Metrocard counts
- MTA Major incidents
- Nighttime Light intesity values 


### 2: Visualizations
1. Heatmap of all variables
2. Linegraph of normalized level of urbanization, metrocard counts, & MTA incidents
3. Linegraph of number of incidents over time, broken down by type of incident


### 3: Regressions
- Model 1: Number of Incidents = B0 + B(Avg Light Intensity)
- Model 2: Monthly Metro Card Count = B0 + B(Avg Light Intensity)
